- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and accessibility
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that help reduce inequality in STEM and society as a whole.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help maintaining MDN

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: myFirstName@myLastName.org
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have a public health degree. Oddly, it comes in handy as a web developer, technical writer, and professional cat herder.
