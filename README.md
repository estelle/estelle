### Hi there 👋

My name is Estelle. A little about me:


- 🔭 I work with @openwebdocs on maintaining @MDN, 
- 📝 I am author of [Learn HTML](https://web.dev/learn/html) and co-author of [CSS: The Definitive Guide](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/css-the-definitive/9781098117603/)
- 🌱 I’m always learning CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and accessibility
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that help reduce inequality in STEM and society as a whole.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help maintaining MDN
- 💬 Ask me about what you can do to be more inclusive.
- 📫 How to reach me: myFirstName@myLastName.org
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her
- ⚠️ I value kindness over niceties
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a public health degree. Oddly, it comes in handy as a web developer, technical writer, and professional cat herder.

You can find me on <a rel="me" href="https://front-end.social/@estelle">Mastodon</a>. I am no longer on Twitter.
